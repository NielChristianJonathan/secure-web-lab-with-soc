# Day 0 - Project Orientation

## Project Name
Secure Web Lab with SOC

##Why I Choose This Project
I want to strengthen my understanding through real practice in:
- How web server works (client-server, HTTP request/response)
- The fundamentals of cybersecurity (web attacks & logging)
- How a SOC monitors and analyzes security event

This project is intended to prepare myself before:
- Applying for an internship
- Learning more advanced topics in AI or Data Science

## What I Already Know
- Web applications are based on the client-server model
- Communication happens through HTTP request and response
- Web application can be attacked in many ways (SQL Injection, Brute force)

## What I Want To Learn
- How the web server is built
- How attacks are recorded and stored in logs
- How a SOC detects and analyzes security event

## Current Status
Planning and Learning phase

##Notes
What I Learn today:
- How to make GitHub repository
- How to make file and folder structures
